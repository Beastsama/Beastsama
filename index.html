<h3>WHAT IS VIRTUAL REALITY?</h3>
<p> Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated environment with scenes and objects 
    that appear to be real, making the user feel they are immersed in their surroundings. 
    This environment is perceived through a device known as a Virtual Reality headset or helmet. 
    VR allows us to immerse ourselves in video games as if we were one of the characters, learn how to perform heart 
    surgery or improve the quality of sports training to maximise performance.
</p>

<p>Although this may seem extremely futuristic, 
    its origins are not as recent as we might think. In fact,
    many people consider that one of the first Virtual Reality
    devices was called Sensorama, a machine with a built-in seat that played 3D movies,
    gave off odours and generated vibrations to make the experience as vivid as possible. 
    The invention dates back as far as the mid-1950s. Subsequent technological and 
    software developments over the following years brought with them a progressive evolution 
    both in devices and in interface design.

<h3>DIFFERENCES WITH AUGMENTED REALITY
   </h3>
<p> Despite being a technology that originated decades ago, many people are still unfamiliar with the
    concept of Virtual Reality. It is also quite common to confuse the term Virtual Reality with augmented reality.
</p>
<p>
    The main difference between the two is that VR builds the world in which we immerse ourselves through
     a specific headset. It is fully immersive and everything we see is part of an environment artificially
      constructed through images, sounds, etc. On the other hand, in augmented reality (AR), our own world 
      becomes the framework within which objects, images or similar are placed. Everything we see is in a
       real environment and it may not be strictly necessary to wear a headset. The clearest and most mainstream example 
       of this concept is Pok√©mon Go.
